# Talo
Machine learning model to predicted rent of houses using potential features and LinearRegression, on dataset provided by StreetEasy

# Architecture

# Data Collection:
The house rent dataset was provided by StreetEasy, collected from the New York cities of manhattan, queens, brooklyn all of these data are stored as comma seprated values

# Data Preprocessing
The features with positive correlation were extracted and made as one of the features columns
The target feature was extracted from the dataframe and made as the target columns

# Data Test Train Split
To Provide unbaised validation, the dataset is split into test and train data with train 80% and test 20%

# Modelling
Mutiple LinearRegression was used to train the model
The trained model was saved using pickle

# Web app Deployment
